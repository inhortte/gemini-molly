Sitting in the Southeast of Houston on my paper route, I listen to this, wondering why I hadn't rolled enough papers for the night. I sigh and chalk it all up to absurdity. The Boss, whose name I forget, will be very angry at me tomorrow, for 5 or 6 papers will not be delivered. The clients shall call and complain. I shall be disparaiged.
