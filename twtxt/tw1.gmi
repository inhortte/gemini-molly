Miniature #4 'Precluded Poet' finished, a modal experiment with different pentatonics over minor and lydian chords. Renata bookends it. #music #BronzePomegranate

Monobiopsychosis is finished. The mix is muddy, but that is ok for now. Overall, the guitar parts accentuate the lugubrious atmosphere. #music #BronzePomegranate

The matra-bass I've LAID OUT is excellent. I'm not sure of my absolute groove capacity, but fuck um. #music #BronzePomegranate
