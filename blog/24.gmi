Is Kacerov hell? I don't think so. I am unable to type without thinking about my fingers. That is a bad thing. Time whistles around me. At least we have a new washing machine here. I go back over and over again to the words.... life is just a series of moments, one after the other. I gotta get out of it. Maybe Michal well help me on Sunday.
