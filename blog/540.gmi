# A Silently Widening Rift
## Topics: creativity, relationships
## 2021-09-17

I was going over in my mind whether it was important to share similar taste in *Music* and *Art* during a relationship. I suspect that it's not a problem for most relationships, though when one of the participants of said relationship is *passionate* about particular *arts* or *musics*, it **is** a problem.

Creating art or music is a deeply personal pursuit and lack of appreciation from a partner, even if said partner is *supportive of the activity* (as Marisa was), can debilitate the whole partnership, creating a silently widening rift. It happened with Marisa and myself. Well, it was one of the factors that led to my leaving. The rift widened over time into a ravine and then bottomless gulf. On one edge I stood with my music. On the opposite edge, she stood, not interested in listening.

Understanding another's artistic objectives is essential. Sitting with the art and pondering it is essential. This I say in the context of marriage, long term partnerships in general, and any sort of relationship where two humans are cohabitants, sharing significant blocks of time together.
