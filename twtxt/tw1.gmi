I'm listening to Hup Jaum Tiriz (Drone #3). It's sufficiently different than the first two to make me crack a simper. I did this one in several tracks, the first being the synth and the 'Pa!'. There are two tracks of guitar, but they are relatively sparse. #music #drone

I spent a good part of the day trying to organise the synth parts on Feudal Fetish. In the end, I think the piece is finished. I'll have to listen back in a few days with a clearer mind to make sure. #music #PodélSměrů
